# CMS_Bot
The **CMS_Bot** is a multi-purpose, lightweight application that interacts with the [**Discord API**](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) to enhance server experience in the **CMS Discord Server**.

However, since `v3.0` the bot has been designed to be compatible with any server.

*Features:*

- `v1.0: BETA` Has advanced message pruning commands
- `v1.5: BETA` Stores all messages read in a day-by-day [.json](http://www.json.org/) file
  - Log files are both programmatically formatted to be both easily human-readable
  - Logs from a given day or message ID can be retrieved
  - This function can be turned off for specific channels for security
- `v1.8: RELEASE` Certain administrator commands are given only to the server owner and members authorized by CMS_Bot administrators.
- `v2.2: ALPHA` Can host customizable countdown games within a designated #countdown channel
- `v2.4: RELEASE` Initializes and maintains a #member_logs channel, logging various member actions
- `v2.6: BETA` Contains a spam detector and automatically deletes spam
- `v2.8: RELEASE` Upon adding the bot to a server, all necessary channels are automatically confured within the server.
